# TIC-TAC-toe_Qt

Game tic-tac-toe implemented through the Qt on C++

Implementation of the console version of the game TIC TAC toe via the Qt framework. At this stage, the program allows you to play the game, but without computer control (i.e. 2 players on the same computer). We plan to implement the game over the Internet (PvP) and with a computer (PvE).
